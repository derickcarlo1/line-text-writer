# Line Text Writer
This Python program allows you to write multiple lines of text to a file named "mylife.txt".

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your computer.

# Running the Program in an IDE
1. Open your preferred IDE (e.g. PyCharm, Spyder, etc.)
2. Open the "text_line_writer.py" file in the IDE.
3. Run the program by clicking on the "Run" button or by pressing the F5 key.
4. Running the Program in Visual Studio Code

# Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Open the "text_line_writer.py" file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the integrated terminal by clicking on "Terminal" from the top menu, then "New Terminal".
3. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the "text_line_writer.py" file is saved.
4. Run the program by typing python text_line_writer.py and pressing enter.

# Usage
(a) When you run the program, you will see a header and a prompt to enter a line of text.
(b) Type your desired text and press enter.
(c) You will be prompted to enter another line of text. Type "y" to add another line or "n" to finish.
(d) If you choose to add another line, repeat steps 2 and 3 until you are finished.
(e) When you are finished, a file named "mylife.txt" will be created in the same directory as the program, containing all of the lines of text you entered.

Note: If the file "mylife.txt" already exists in the same directory as the program, the program will append any new lines of text to the existing file.

# About me and this program
Hi there, I'm Derick Carlo S. Herrera, a computer engineering student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I created this Python program to help me write multiple lines of text to a file easily.
As someone who enjoys writing and often needs to organize my thoughts into text files, I found it tedious to manually write each line one by one. That's why I decided to create this program that would allow me to write as many lines as I want and save them all in a single file.

To use the program, simply run it in an IDE or Visual Studio Code, and follow the prompts to enter your text. The program will then save your lines to a file named "mylife.txt". You can add as many lines as you want, and when you're done, simply type "n" when prompted if you want to add more lines.
I hope this program can be useful not just for myself, but for others who also need an easier way to write multiple lines of text to a file.
